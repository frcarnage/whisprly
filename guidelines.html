  <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 2025</p>

  <p>Whisprly is a place for open, safe, and honest expression. To keep our community positive and respectful, all users must follow these guidelines:</p>

  <h2>1. Respect Others</h2>
  <p>Treat everyone with kindness and fairness. Harassment, hate speech, personal attacks, bullying, or discriminatory content will not be tolerated in any form — whether in posts, chats, or comments.</p>

  <h2>2. Respect Anonymity & Privacy</h2>
  <p>Many Whisprly users post anonymously. Do not attempt to reveal, guess, or share someone’s personal identity. Protect your own privacy and respect the privacy of others.</p>

  <h2>3. No Harmful or Illegal Content</h2>
  <p>Do not post or promote content that includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Violence, threats, or incitement to harm</li>
    <li>Encouragement of self-harm or suicide</li>
    <li>Child exploitation or sexually explicit material</li>
    <li>Illegal activity, scams, or abusive behavior</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. No Spam, Advertising, or Manipulation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No mass messaging, flooding, or irrelevant posting</li>
    <li>No bots, scripts, or automation to manipulate engagement</li>
    <li>No self-promotion, advertising, or misleading content without permission</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Use Reporting Tools Responsibly</h2>
  <p>If you see content that breaks these rules, use the in-app <strong>Report</strong> feature. Do not misuse reporting to target or silence others unfairly — false reports may lead to warnings or account action.</p>

  <h2>6. Age Requirement</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use Whisprly. Content inappropriate for minors is strictly prohibited.</p>

  <h2>7. Enforcement</h2>
  <p>Breaking these rules may result in content removal, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans. You will always be informed of the reason if action is taken against your account.</p>

  <h2>8. Appeals</h2>
  <p>If you believe your content or account was removed unfairly, you can submit an appeal directly in the app. Appeals are reviewed within 5–7 business days.</p>

  <h2>Let’s Keep Whisprly Safe</h2>
  <p>Every action shapes the community. Let’s work together to create a safe, respectful space where everyone can express themselves openly — whether posting publicly or anonymously.</p>
