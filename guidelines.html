  <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
  <p>Last updated: July 2025</p>

  <p>Whisprly is a platform for open, safe, and honest expression. To keep our community welcoming and respectful, we ask all users to follow these guidelines:</p>

  <h2>1. Be Respectful</h2>
  <p>Treat everyone with kindness. Personal attacks, hate speech, harassment, and bullying will not be tolerated — whether in posts, chats, or comments.</p>

  <h2>2. Respect Anonymity</h2>
  <p>Many users prefer to post anonymously. Do not attempt to reveal or guess someone's identity. Respect everyone's privacy — even if you disagree with them.</p>

  <h2>3. No Harmful or Illegal Content</h2>
  <p>Posting content that promotes violence, self-harm, abuse, illegal activity, or discrimination is strictly prohibited.</p>

  <h2>4. No Spam or Manipulation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t use bots or scripts to post or like content</li>
    <li>No mass messaging, repetitive posts, or irrelevant links</li>
    <li>No self-promotion, advertising, or misleading content</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Use Reporting Responsibly</h2>
  <p>If you see something that violates these guidelines, use the in-app <strong>Report</strong> feature. False reporting or misuse of this tool may result in warnings or bans.</p>

  <h2>6. Age Requirement</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use Whisprly. Content inappropriate for minors is not allowed.</p>

  <h2>7. Violations and Enforcement</h2>
  <p>Breaking these rules may lead to content removal, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans. You will always be informed of the reason if action is taken against your account.</p>

  <h2>8. Appeals</h2>
  <p>If you feel your content or account was removed unfairly, you can appeal directly through the app. All appeals are reviewed carefully.</p>

  <h2>Let’s Keep Whisprly Safe for All</h2>
  <p>Your actions shape this community. Let's create a space where everyone feels heard and safe — whether posting publicly or anonymously.</p>
